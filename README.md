# Homework 2 : My first system call

## 1. System call tracing
In order to get the name of the system call, I created a second array `syscall_names[]`, indexed in the same way as `syscalls[]`. It allows to do a simple table lookup of the name of the syscall, given `num`.

## 2. Date system call
Modifications in order to add the date system call :

1. Created the file `date.c` in which I copied the given code, and added a printf statement to standard out (fd 1) which prints the date.
2. `Makefile` : added `_date` to `UPROGS`
3. `syscall.h` : added syscall number for the date syscall
4. `syscall.c` : declared and added a new `sys_date` function to the `syscalls` array (+ to the `syscall_names` array).
5. `usys.S` : added `SYSCALL(date)`
6. `user.h` : added `date()` to the list of syscalls.
7. `sysproc.c` : define the `sys_date` function which gets the argument (a `struct rtcdate *` and calls `cmostime()` with it to populate it.

Output :

*3 consecutive calls, with a few seconds inbetween each call*

## 3. Dup2
### 1. Adding the dup2 system call
Modifications in order to add the dup2 system call : 

1. I repeated modifications 3. 4. 5. 6. from above.
2. `sysfile.c` :
	* defined the `sys_dup2()` function which gets the arguments (`oldfd` and associated `struct file` `f` and `newfd`) and tries to allocate `newfd` to `f`.
	* defined a new version of `fdalloc()`, named `fdalloc2()`, which allows to specify a new fd.

### 2. Test program

1. Created the `dup2_test.c` file
2. `Makefile` : added `_dup2test` to `UPROGS`

The test program opens a file (creates it if necessary), writes to its file descriptor `oldfd`, uses `dup2` to duplicate it to `newfd` and writes again to the file using `newfd`. I then used `cat` to print the content of the file to the console.

### 3. Using any new fd

In order to show that (almost) any new fd can be used with `dup2`, my test program simply (tries to) acquire the biggest fd possible, ie. the 15'th. Note that in the above set up, oldfd is the fd 3 and the regular `dup` would have returned `4` for newfd.

* `Makefile` : Copied modifications from Prof. Andersen to add `make tarball`
